# WHO Tweets Clustering Using KMeans And Silhouette Method
This project is focused on clustering tweets related to COVID-19 from the World Health Organization's account. The goal is to group similar tweets together and analyze their content to better understand the overall message being communicated by WHO on this topic.

The code uses the KMeans clustering algorithm and Silhouette method to evaluate the performance of the clusters.
# Prerequisites
The following libraries are used in the code and need to be installed:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Numpy
Scikit-learn
# Running the code
Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the WHO-Tweets-Clustering-Using-KMean-And-Silhouette-Method.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file
Run the code cells in order to see the results of the clustering and evaluation
# Results
The code provides visualizations of the tweet clusters and their respective word clouds, as well as the Silhouette score for each number of clusters tested. The Silhouette score provides insight into the quality of the clustering solution and is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

# Conclusion
The code provides a way to analyze and group similar tweets related to COVID-19 from the World Health Organization's account. The results can be used to better understand the overall message being communicated and to identify any patterns or themes in the tweets.
